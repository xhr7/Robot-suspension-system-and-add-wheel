* suspension system
 
Why do we use it and why is it important?
It has many benefits, including that it is able to absorb shocks and vibrations and isolates them from the robot's body when it walks on an uneven road or bumps
It also provides stability and stability to the body and makes its movement more smooth
 It is also important that it makes the wheels touch the road, whatever the obstacle or bump you pass through
